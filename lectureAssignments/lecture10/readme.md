1. Stacks and Queues
   Bootstrap Exercise
   In this task, we are given a complete implementation of a doubly linked list, and we are asked to implement 2 data structures, namely Queue, and Stack.

A queue is a FIFO (first-in-first-out) container, with operations enqueue, and dequeue for putting in data at the front of the queue, and taking out data from the back of the queue, respectively.

A stack is a LIFO (last-in-first-out) container, with operations push and pop, for putting in data at the front/top of the stack, and taking out data from the front/top, respectively.

Both data structures have a peek method, to see the value at the front/top, but not take it out, as well as the usual size and isEmpty methods.
